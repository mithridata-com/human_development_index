## Goal
The goal of our research is developing of HDI indicator for 30 countries (all members of European Union + Cabo Verde, South Africa and Russia) based on publicly available data.

## Datasets
For now, our code parses following datasets in a form of time series with a breakdown by country:
* "LifeExp" = "SP.DYN.LE00.IN",
* "DeathRate" = "SP.DYN.CDRT.IN",
* "FertilityRate" = "SP.DYN.TFRT.IN",
* "GdpPerCapita" = "NY.GDP.PCAP.CD",
* "CO2_emissions" = "EN.ATM.CO2E.PC"
