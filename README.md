## Goal
The goal of our research is developing of HDI indicator for 30 countries (all members of European Union + Cabo Verde, South Africa and Russia) based on publicly available data.

## Datasets
For now, our code parses following datasets in a form of time series with a breakdown by country.
The data for HDI is currently represeneted by prefixes "Liv" for living and health conditions, "Edu" for educational situation, "Econ" for economical conditions.
* "Liv_LifeExp" = "SP.DYN.LE00.IN", 
* "Liv_DeathRate" = "SP.DYN.CDRT.IN",
* "Liv_FertilityRate" = "SP.DYN.TFRT.IN",
                    
* "Edu_GovernExpend" = "SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS",
* "Edu_PupilTeacherRatio" = "SE.PRM.ENRL.TC.ZS",
* "Edu_SchoolEnroll" = "SE.PRM.NENR",
                    
* "Econ_GdpPerCapita" = "NY.GDP.PCAP.CD",
* "Econ_CO2emissions" = "EN.ATM.CO2E.PC",
* "Econ_Unemplyment" = "SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS"
